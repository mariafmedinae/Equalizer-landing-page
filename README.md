## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS media queries
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned how to change the color to a SVG image file using the filter property. In this case was very useful to use a hexadecimal conversor to CSS filter. In my case, [I used this one](https://isotropic.co/tool/hex-color-to-css-filter/).

### Continued development

-The next step for me is learn SASS.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - The CSS3 documentation was really helpful when I was need to remember the sintaxis of some properties and how to use them correctly.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - When I got stuck at diferents points in the project, I searched in this page for solutions.
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/#es) - I learned flexbox with this game.
